## Describe how to lead the transition to Agile architecture during a Transformation

### Conway's Law

> Organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs
> which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations .
>
> Melvin Conway

* Architecture mimics team structure
* If teams are large and disorganized, the architecture will be too
* If teams are loosely coupled and Agile, the architecture will be too
* Evolve team structure and architecture together

### Steps for successful change

1. Establish a sense of urgency
2. Create a powerful guiding coalition
3. Develop the vision and strategy
4. Communicate the vision
5. Empower employees for broad-based action
6. Generate short-term wins
7. Consolidate gains and produce more wins
8. Anchor new approaches in the culture

### Collaborate with the Lean-Agile Center of Excellence (LACE)

* Lean-Agile transformations are typically led by a team that is committed to delivering improvements
* Transformation teams should include executive participants
* Architects should provide technical guidance to and collaborate with the LACE

> A guiding coalition that operates as an effective team can process more
> information , more quickly. It can also speed the implementation of new
> approaches because powerful people are truly informed and committed to key
> decisions.
